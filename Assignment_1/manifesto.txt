I believe that all letterforms are powerful and powerless at the same time.
I believe that all letterforms can be flexible in its form as long as the recipients agree on its format.
I believe that no letterform is inherently good nor inherently bad.
Letterforms are the foundations of communication but can also dismantle communication.
The love for letterforms should be without boundaries.
