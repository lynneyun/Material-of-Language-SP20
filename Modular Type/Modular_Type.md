# Modular Type #

## A deep dive into the structure of the written language ##
What is the smallest unit of language? A quick google search on the topic tells me that a morpheme is the smallest unit of a language that can carry meaning — basically a word. The ‘smallest unit’ is a character — `a`, `b`, `c`, and so forth. But what if we could go further than that? A type designer knows that designs on the character is not unique. For example, a design of a `D` is derived from the left side of an `H` and the right side of an `O`. In the lower case, this is even more pronounced. With the ‘n’ and the ‘o’, we can effectively gain enough information to construct the `p`, `d`, `b`, and `q`. So then, perhaps these ‘letter parts’ could be argued to be the very smallest unit of language. What happens when we break it down into those smallest pieces, and try to modify the material of language from there?

## So, what IS the very smallest unit? ##

This kind of structure of ‘rational’ thinking probably can date back to the Renaissance and the [Roman du Roi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_du_Roi). The so-called logical design of it wasn’t the most beautiful, but it did lay down the idea of the ‘rational letter’. There is also a recent attempt at breaking down the typeface Futura (I’ve seen it at art book fairs/McNally Jackson, but can’t find the book online).

## What will the project look like? ##
In short, I think it will be an interface where you can change parameters of the ‘molecular structure’ and it will change the entire outlook of the typeface. Ideally, it would have some sort of GUI where you can change parts, and it will affect a bigger body of type. Some similar attempts that have been made are [Phase](https://www.eliashanzer.com/phase/), and to a larger extent [V-Fonts](https://v-fonts.com) (although their objectives are obviously different).

## Some necessary parameters ##
The world of type is big, and for this project to work I think I would need to define what I am trying to ‘take apart’ into smaller pieces. 

Some initial ideas:

- A capital-only set
	- Pros: The construction is less complicated than lowercase, potentially more durable to unexpected shapes
	- Cons: Less modularity than lowercase
- A lowercase-only set
	- Pros: It’s more modular than uppercase, potentially more fun in longer text
	- Cons: lots of similar shapes might work against legibility

## Notes and Thoughts from Class 4/22/2020 ##
- Perhaps it could be more interesting as a monospace typeface?
